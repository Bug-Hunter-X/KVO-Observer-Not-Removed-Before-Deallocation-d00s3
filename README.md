# Objective-C KVO Memory Management Issue

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) in Objective-C.  The bug arises from failing to remove an observer before the observed object is deallocated, potentially leading to crashes or undefined behavior.

## Problem

When an object is observed using KVO, and that object is deallocated without removing the observer, the observer attempts to access the memory of the deallocated object, resulting in a crash.  This is especially problematic if the observer is a weak reference. The solution involves ensuring that observers are always removed using `removeObserver:` before the observed object is deallocated. 

## Solution

The solution demonstrates proper KVO observer removal before the object is deallocated, using `removeObserver:` in the `dealloc` method or before the observed object loses scope.  This ensures memory safety and prevents crashes.
